### What is SiteCubes?

**SiteCubes** is a light-weight Java-based CMS, designed to work in the cloud. It supports the creation of multiple sites that are managed on one single server.

### Yet another CMS?

Hmm, yes. But SiteCubes is different! SiteCubes builds solely upon open-source technologies and frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap, FontAwesome and PrimeFaces. An intuitive interface allows the content editor to quickly create and easily maintain responsive websites.

### Which technologies are used?

* Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.0
* FontAwesome 4.2.0
* JSF 2.2
* PrimeFaces 5.1
* HTML 5, CSS 3
